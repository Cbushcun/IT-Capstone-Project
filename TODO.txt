This is a general purpose .txt file to list any TODOs for the group. Anything listed in here should be worked on. Anything that has been worked on and completed, please move it under '--------COMPLETE--------' to indicate that it is worked on and implemented. If something has been completed but needs to be revisited, clearly display the problems under the task and move it to 'TODO'. This will help keep track of what has been done and what will need to be done as well as any issues that need to be revisited and fixed.
